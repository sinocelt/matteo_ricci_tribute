        <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Why I Chose To Do My
        Tribute For Him</h2>Matteo Ricci is one of my personal
        heroes. Having been born over 400 years ago, his influence
        is still huge, and his linguistic and cultural achievements
        astound people even today. His life story inspires me for
        many reasons, among others, for learning languages,
        especially Mandarin Chinese, and for being a cultural bridge between the East and West. As the first ever Westerner
        allowed, as an advisor, into the Forbidden City, he paved
        the trail for later great Sinologists to follow. The idea
        of going into a foreign culture, completely cut off from
        any language even remotely resembling one's own, with no
        dictionary or local person who could speak your language, for
        some may seem to be a totally daunting or even
        impossible task. Yet, Ricci became a scholar
        of the Chinese language and culture, and to top it off, was able to mesmerize Chinese scholars
        with his own abilities and knowledge of their culture and
        language.

        <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Quick Bio</h2>Matteo
        Ricci, Chinese name 利瑪竇 (romanized Chinese lì mǎ dòu)
        was born on 6 October 1552 in the Italian region of
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marche">Marche</a>. He died
        11 May 1610 in Bejing, China and was the first Westerner to
        be buried in Beijing. Westerners were normally not allowed to be buried there, but Diego de Pantoja, a fellow Jesuit, appealed to the Ming Court for permission for Ricci to be buried there in light of Ricci's     contributions to China. Soon after, the appeal was granted.
        Ricci entered the Society of Jesus (a.k.a. the Jesuits) in April 1571.<br/>
        He applied to be a missionary, and later sailed for <a target="_blank" href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa">Goa</a>, from Lisbon, Portugual in March 1578, and arrived in
        September 1578. He worked as a teacher and in the ministry in Goa
        until 1582, when he was sent to Macau. A true <a target="_blank"
        href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_man">Renaissance
        man</a>, he was both a polymath and polyglot. He studied, and was an expert in, many
        subjects including: mathematics, astronomy, cosmology,
        philosophy, cartography, and theology. In addition to his own native Italian, he was
        a master of Mandarin Chinese and Classical Chinese, Latin,
        and Portuguese.

        <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Life in
        China</h2>Ricci arrived in <a target="_blank" href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau">Macau</a> on August
        1582. Macau at the time was a Portuguese colony, like Goa.
        Foreigners, in general, were quite restricted from going
        across the border from Macau into <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty">Ming China.</a> In 1583, Ricci along with his companion Ruggieri, were invited to stay in Zhaoqing, by the governor. 
        Ricci lived throughout Eastern China over the years. In 1601, Ricci was
        invited to become an adviser to the imperial court of the
        Wanli Emperor, the first Westerner to be invited into the
        Forbidden City. This honour was in recognition of Ricci's
        scientific abilities, chiefly his predictions of solar
        eclipses, which were significant events in the Chinese
        world. Ricci was given free access to the Forbidden City and the emperor gave him patronage in support of completing the Zhifang waiji, China's
        first global atlas. <br/>
